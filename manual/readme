    Description of operation and commands (10 marks)

MyShell is a fully-featured shell written in C that can execute commands, redirect input and output and execute processes in the background.


List of built-in commands:
    - cd: Change directory
    - clr: Clear the screen
    - dir: List the contents of the current directory
    - environ: List all environment variables
    - echo: Print a string to the console
    - help: Display the user manual
    - pause: Pause the shell until the user presses enter
    - quit: Exit the shell

    Description of environment concepts (10 marks)
ENVIROM

Upon starting up MyShell, a new enviroment variable called `SHELL` is created and set to the path where the shell executable is located.
The command `environ` can be used to list all of the environment variables currently set on the system.
When executing a non-built-in command, an environment variable called `PARENT` is created and links to where the shell executable is stored.


    Description of i/o redirection (10 marks)

    Redirecting to stdout has multiple options:

    - `>`: Redirects the output of a command to a file, overwriting the file if it already exists
    - `>>`: Redirects the output of a command to a file, appending to the file if it already exists
    - 
    Description of the process concept, and the differences between background and foreground execution (5 marks)

    Overall layout and display of understanding (10 marks)

    Inclusion of four references from peer-reviewed sources such as books, articles etc. (5 marks). Note that the inclusion of Wikipedia, or a random website which just happened to come up in a Google search will result in a grade of 0 for this aspect.
